# Simple TFE Deployment

This example demonstrates a minimal configuration for deploying Terraform 
Enterprise (TFE) on AWS using this module. It provisions supporting 
infrastructure such as DNS records, a bastion host, and EC2 instances, and 
outputs the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the TFE endpoint. Most
inputs are omitted in favour of using defaults.
